# Architecture

This project implements a **rule-based autonomous AI agent** for learning path planning.

## Components

1. **User Interface**
   - Collects learning goal, skill level, and daily time availability

2. **Decision Engine**
   - Determines learning intensity (light / regular)
   - Determines learning depth (foundational / applied)

3. **Planning Module**
   - Generates a structured learning roadmap
   - Adjusts recommendations based on constraints

## Why this is an AI Agent
Unlike a static chatbot, this agent:
- Makes independent decisions
- Applies rules to adapt output
- Can re-plan when constraints change
