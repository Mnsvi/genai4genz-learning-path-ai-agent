# Agent Flow

1. User provides learning goal
2. Agent collects constraints (skill level, time per day)
3. Agent evaluates constraints using decision rules
4. Agent selects learning strategy (intensity + depth)
5. Agent generates a personalized learning roadmap
6. Agent can re-adjust the plan if inputs change
