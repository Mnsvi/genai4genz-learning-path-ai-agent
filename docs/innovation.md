# Innovation

## What Makes This Agent Unique

- Designed specifically for **Gen-Z learners**
- Uses minimal inputs to reduce friction
- Acts autonomously instead of responding passively
- Decision logic is transparent and explainable

## Creative Element

The agent adapts learning strategies based on **time scarcity**, a real Gen-Z problem, rather than assuming unlimited study time.

This makes the learning path realistic and sustainable.
