# Decision Logic

The AI agent uses rule-based reasoning to make decisions.

## Inputs
- Learning goal
- Skill level (beginner / intermediate)
- Available time per day

## Rules Applied

- If time per day < 30 minutes → light learning intensity
- If time per day ≥ 30 minutes → regular learning intensity
- If skill level = beginner → foundational depth
- If skill level = intermediate → applied depth

## Outcome
The agent autonomously selects:
- Learning intensity
- Learning depth
- Roadmap structure
