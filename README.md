# Gen-Z Learning Path AI Agent

## Overview
An autonomous AI agent that creates personalized learning paths based on user goals, skill level, and time availability.

## Why AI Agent?
The system makes independent decisions using defined logic rather than responding statically like a chatbot.

## How It Works
- Collects user inputs
- Applies decision rules
- Generates adaptive learning roadmap

## Folder Structure
- src/: agent logic
- docs/: architecture, flow, decisions, innovation

## Creative Feature
This agent uniquely adapts learning plans based on time scarcity, a common Gen-Z constraint, enabling realistic and sustainable learning paths.
